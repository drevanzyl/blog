## 10 &quot;The operertor is in discussion with this office to continue the practice of Par-cooking i.e. non-continous cooking and is applying to the Ohio Dept of Health for a variance. A compliance time line can not be set for time it takes the Ohio Department of Health to consider a variance but a time line can be set for requiring submission. Obviously, the sooner this gets submitted the sooner you will have a decision towards allowing this practice- but one month should be sufficient time to submit the  necessary documents. Show proof you have made this submission by 10/11/16.&quot;
